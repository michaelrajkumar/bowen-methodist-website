<!-- # Methodist Youth Fellowship -->

Youth Fellowship helps our young adults discover the plans and purposes God has for their lives in an environment specifically designed for them.

At Bowen Church, the MYF takes the lead in the Worship Ministry of the church. MYF, as a major initiative, hosts the Open Mic program every Friday.

On October 15, 2023, the MYF celebrated Youth Sunday with the youth conducting the service. We decided to theme the day as an Outreach service. Boosted by the community formed by PBnJ, the day was a resounding success with both the young and old attending the service and the session at YMCA!

Our community came together to lend a hand, and we had volunteers from around the city to put together an amazing day under the banner: **Ctrl + Z: Undo to Renew**.
