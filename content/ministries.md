## Sunday School

![Bowen Sunday School](/images/Bowen-Sunday-School.webp)

Families are the pillars of our society. We are here to come alongside you as parents in the joys and trials of raising young children and to be a partner in preaching the gospel to the youngest generation. Our vision is that kids participate in worship for the Glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

**Sunday School begins at 11 AM during worship**. Your children will be in a safe environment, with screened and trained teachers, where they will learn Biblical truth, sing songs, do activities, memorize scripture, and have a fun time doing it.

Contact Mrs. Rosy Tennison or Mrs. Greta Aaron for further information.

## Pastorate Committee

The Pastorate Committee (PC) is elected by the General Body of the Church, using the electoral process as outlined in the Constitution of The Church of North India. The Pastorate Committee has been entrusted with the administrative work related to the Church. The Pastorate Committee members work in an honorary capacity, discussing significant issues and requirements, to take time-bound and cost-effective decisions.

The Presbyter of the Church assumes the role of the Chairman of the Pastorate Committee, envisaging the authority conferred to him by the constitution of The Church of North India (CNI). As a chairman, he heads all matters of the Church and presides over all meetings.

All administrative activities related to repair, maintenance, budget, accounts, new projects, Church helper manpower management, Security management and other related tasks of the Church, are performed by the Pastorate Committee. The Pastorate Committee elects the Secretary who is in-charge of leading the initiation and conclusion of all administrative work.

The Pastorate Committee also elects the Treasurer, who manages the finances of the Church, relating to receipts related to Sunday Service offerings, thanksgiving offering, donations received from members and non-members. The treasurer also reviews and approves routine administrative expenditures of the Church.

All Pastorate Committee members provide their inputs during meetings to reach viable decisions, relating to the matters of the Church. These members belong to varied ages and bring rich experience from their diverse professional backgrounds.

**The Pastorate Committee meets every 3rd Sunday after service** and the meeting minutes are duly circulated to serve as a reference as well as a record of discussions.
